### Upgrading from Version < 0.7.0
Starting with version 0.7.0 the complete code base is rewritten and functionality changed.
All setting from previous versions will be deleted.  
You need do add all apps to autostart again!

### Supported apps

- All native apps in Sailfish OS 3.4.0.24 (Pallas YllÃ¤stunturi) and below
- Non jailed apps in Sailfish OS 4.0.1.45 (Koli)
- Android apps

### Implemented Features

- Define start order of apps on boot (still depending on startup time)
- Define startup delay in settings

### Planned Features
Start jailed apps on Sailfish OS 4.0.1.45 (Koli) and later.   
There seems to be a permission issue when starting app. 
I didn't figured it out yet, how to solve this. Maybe someone else has an idea?
